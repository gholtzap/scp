# SCP
This repo is not production-ready yet. I am still developing the core features.

The SCP (Service Communication Proxy) is a critical routing component in the 5G architecture. It provides indirect communication between Network Functions (NFs), handling service discovery, load balancing, routing, and reselection for service-based interfaces in the 5G Core Network.

SCP is a Rust implementation of 3GPP's 5G SCP specification. The specification can be found [here](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3447).
